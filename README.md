# Data-Structures-
Data structures in Java - ongoing.

This is a personal project of mine to get better at Data Structures.
I plan on compiling examples of all the data structures in Java

This project will include folders 

1. Lists

  -Examples of ArrayList, LinkedLists, DoublyLinkedList
  
  -We will be using an example of an Employee database
  
2. Recursion

  -just a basic example of how recursion works
  
3. Sorting Algorithm

  -Array implementation basics to get started on diff sorts
  
  -Bubble sort
  
  -Counting sort
  
  -Insertion sort
  
  -Merge sort
  
  -Quick sort
  
  -Radix sort
  
  -Selection sort
  
  -Shell sort
  
  -Bucket sort 
  
4. Stack

  -using same Employee database example
  
  -Linked list stack example
  
  -Array stack example
  
5. Queue

  -Array implementation of Queue
  
6. HashTable

  -Used Employee example again
  
  -SimpleHashTable has linear probing implementation to avoid collisions
  
  -ChainedHashtable has chaining implementation to avoid collisions
  
 7. Search Algorithms 
 
  -Linear Search Algorithm
  
  -Binary Search Algorithm
 
 8. Trees 
 
 -Made Tree and TreeNode
 
 -Insertion od data in tree
 
 -In-order, pre-order,post-order Traversals
 
 -get, min, max methods
 
 -deleting data that has no child, 1 child and 2 children.
 
 9. Heaps (Coming Soon)
