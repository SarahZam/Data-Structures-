# Data-Structures-
Data structures in Java - ongoing.

This is a personal project of mine to get better at Data Structures.
I plan on compiling examples of all the data structures in Java

This project will include folders 

1. Lists
  -Examples of ArrayList, LinkedLists, DoublyLinkedList
  -We will be using an example of an Employee database
2. Recursion
  -just a basic example of how recursion works
3. Sorting Algorithm
  -Array implementation basics to get started on diff sorts
  -Bubble sort
  -Counting sort
  -Insertion sort
  -Merge sort
  -Quick sort
  -Radix sort
  -Selection sort
  -Shell sort
  -Bucket sort (coming soon)
4. Stack
  -using same Employee database example
  -Linked list stack example
  -Array stack example
5. Queue
  -Array implementation of Queue
6. HashTable
  -Used Employee example again
  -SimpleHashTable has linear probing implementation to avoid collisions
  -ChainedHashtable has chaining implementation to avoid collisions
 7. Search Algorithms (coming soon)
 8. Trees (Coming Soon)
 9. Heaps (Coming Soon)
